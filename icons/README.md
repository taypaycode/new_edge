# Extension Icons

This folder should contain the extension icons in PNG format:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels  
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

## Icon Design

The icon should represent education, learning, or knowledge. Some ideas:
- Book with a lightbulb
- Graduation cap
- Brain
- Open book with stars

## Creating Icons

You can use any image editor to create these icons. Here's a simple approach:

1. Create a 128x128 PNG with transparent background
2. Use your preferred design tool (Figma, Photoshop, GIMP, etc.)
3. Save as `icon128.png`
4. Resize to 48x48 and save as `icon48.png`
5. Resize to 16x16 and save as `icon16.png`

## Temporary Solution

Until you create custom icons, you can use simple colored squares or text-based icons. The extension will still work without icons, but they provide a better user experience.
